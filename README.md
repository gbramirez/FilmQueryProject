# Film Query Project

This program is a film database search app. The app will display a user menu screen. The menu allows the user to select either searching the film database by keyword search or film ID. The user can also choose to quit the app.

The app will display the film the user is searching for and all of the films information.

### How to Run

Select an option from the menu.

Enter the information asked by the program.

The program will respond with the corresponding film data.
